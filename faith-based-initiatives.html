                    public safety partnership that has secured $125,000 to combat gun violence
                    against children in the city of Birmingham, in partnership with the Housing 
                    Authority of Birmingham District (HABD), Birmingham Community Faith leaders
                    and Crime Stoppers of Metro Alabama established a Stop Violence against
                    Children Fund.The fund was founded in order to provide reward money for 
                    information leading to the arrest of individuals responsible in five 
                    separate cases involving children under the age of 10.The press conference
                    featured Katrina Grady accompanied by her family, and faith leaders in the community
                    who contributed to this effort. A $25,000 reward will be available for each case. 
                    In coordination with Mayor Woodfin, faith leaders representing more than 20 churches
                    and organizations in the city committed to creating the Stop Gun Violence against 
                    Children Fund. These faith organizations provided contributions ranging from $500 to 
                    $10,000.
